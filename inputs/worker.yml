# Train delivers and collects from/to workstations. On our simulation warehouses
# and workstation are assumed that the materials will deliver the exact please of 
# those instead of parking next to stations or warehouses.
#
# Specs are:
#   name: Unique identifier of the material.
#   x,y: Coordinate of workstations, please note that all location figures should match
#        with the map. If location values and the train's location on the map differs,
#        the simulation will raise an error and shutdown. Also please note that
#        the map starts at (0,0) location.
#   speed: The speed of the train. It is advised to use the numbers between 1 - 100
#          to get proper behaviour of train. Higher the number is faster the process time.
#   load_time: Loading time of all demanded materials. Higher load_time causes
#              longer time to load materials.
#   unload_time:  Unloading time of all demanded materials. Higher unload_time causes
#                 longer time to unload materials.
#   requirements: Required materials of the workstation as a list of 
#                 material name and required amount.
#                 Please enter the in following format (materialName,requestAmount)
